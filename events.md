What the event module offers to the Organiser, Stores, Artists and Social Dancers is explained bellow point by point with the main features. Contact us in order to know more details and book a Demo if necessry to know better the extension of this application.

Events at Points of Tango are defined as any tango event which has a start and end time either on a specific date or on a limited consecutive days (the whole weekend, a full week or even a few days longer). Events are classified by type and their could be: Milongas; Group and Private Classes; Practicas; Championships; Marathons; Festivals; Encuentros; Meetings; Retreats; Vacations.

The Events Module on Points of Tango supports 2 different scopes:

- Local Community Events: Day to day events, what to expect to happen on regular basis or orientated for the local community and wherabouts, meaning all Milongas, Classes, Practicas and local/national competitions or festivals. 

- International Events: Events which normally happens less regularly, like once a year and its target is to catch the interests of dancers living abroad alongside the local community. This section hots big international festivals, championships, marathongs, encuentros, retreats, vacations.

It is possible from the application to list the internation events and each local community by simple selecting the scope from anywhere in the world.

## Listing is totally FREE
Our goal from Points of Tango is to host as many events as possible to be able to offer social dancers all the options available, no to restrict to those organisers who would pay for the service. This will only bring just a narrow option to the dancers.
If an event is not yet loaded on the application, is simply because the organiser has not uploaded it yet, but there is any restriction to do so.
