You must read if you are an organiser of an international event, no matters the size/capacity of the event nor the where the event is localted.

## Points of Tango: General Vision
The purpose of this project is to gather on an unique platform, accessible through mobile and web, everything related to the tango comunity: International Events; Events on Local communities; Tango Stores; DJs, Professional Teachers and Performers, musicians, orchestras. All across the world, joined on a single platform for better communication, integration, accessibility and simplicity for everyone, social dancers, organisers, shop owners and professional artists.

## Events: Problem and Points of Tango Mision on this particular module
Information about events are spread all over the Internet, across countless webpages and platforms. We can mention Facebook as the main one, where organisers rely on list their facebook events or groups to reach out the big audience. However, this platform is not well organised, not tango specific (adding too much noice with unnecessary information), and people are moving away from it reaching other (less toxic) applications.
It is not possible to find a complete and up to date website which host all events there, internationals and local communities, even less a mobile application which makes it all more interactive and simpler. Just few local comminities have (among their own many local websites options) one platform where people rely the most, examples are:
- hoy-milonga.com - Buenos Aires
- londonmilongas.co.uk - London
- tango-argentin.fr - Paris (also used in other french regions)

Anyway, even if these websites had the latest information, each community creates their own system/platform (which beside they are not integrated with other tango sectors, like Artists, Stores and social dancers) making it hard for social dancers to know which platform works best for each city. Points of Tango aims to have them all in one unique platform, where social dancers only should ask where they want to list events from, International or selecting any Country and Region.

Points of Tango offers the platform, contacts organisers, stores and artists to inform them about this revolutionary opportunity. Now, everyone has to do one's bit, uploading the information to make this possible so everyone can enjoy the benefits.


## Events Module Overview

What the event module offers to the Organiser, Stores, Artists and Social Dancers is explained here, point by point detailing the main features. You can contact us in order to know further/specific details but also to request a Demo if necessary, we are more than happy to let you know better about the extension of this application.

*Note: Events at Points of Tango are defined as any tango event which has a start and end time either on a specific date or on a limited consecutive days (a whole weekend or full week, for instance). Events are classified by type: Milongas; Group or Private Classes; Practicas; Championships; Marathons; Festivals; Encuentros; Meetings; Retreats; Vacations.*

The Events Module on Points of Tango supports 2 scopes:

- Local Community Events: Day to day events, what to expect to happen on regular basis or no regular but orientated for the local community. It means, we are able to list all Milongas, Classes, Practicas and local/national competitions or festivals. 

- International Events: Events which normally happen less regularly, like once a year and its target is to catch the interests of dancers living abroad alongside the local community. This section hosts big international festivals, championships, marathongs, encuentros, retreats and vacations.


## Event Listing is totally FREE

Points of Tango's goal is to host as many events as possible to be able to offer social dancers all the options available, with no restriction or reduced to those organisers who would pay for the service. Paid listings will only bring narrowed options to the dancers, Points of Tango will NEVER charge the listing of any event. Therefore, if an event is not yet uploaded on the application, it is simply because the organiser has not uploaded it yet.
