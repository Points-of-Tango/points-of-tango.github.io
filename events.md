# Events Module

## A. Audience and Scope

This document talks about Points of Tango platform general Vision and focuses on the Events Module dedicated for organisers and teachers. You shoud read it if you are:
- a tango teacher who hosts classes anywhere in the world.
- a local events organiser, no matters the size/capacity of the event but targeted to a specific community.
- an international events organiser, no matters the size/capacity of the event nor where the event is localted.

## B. Points of Tango: General Vision - A Worldwide Tango Marketplace

The purpose of the application is to gather on an unique platform (accessible on mobile phones, tablets and web) everything related to the tango comunity: International Events; Local communities Events; Tango Stores; DJs, Professional Teachers and Performers, Musicians, Orchestras. All across the world, everything and everyone, joined on a single platform for a better communication, integration, accessibility and simplicity for social dancers, organisers, shop owners and professional artists.

## C. Events: Points of Tango Mision on this module


### C.1 We need integration on different levels.

#### C.1.a Incomplete and out of date information all over the Internet
Information about events is spread and desorganised all over the Internet, across countless webpages and platforms. Facebook for instance, organisers rely on listing their events or groups to reach out to the big audience. However, the overall information on mentioned platform is not well organised nor tango specific. A few local communities have (among their own many local websites options) one platform where people rely the most but, even if these websites had the latest information, each community creates their own system/platform, making it hard for social dancers to know which platform works best for each city (beside, these websites mainly focus on events). Examples are:
- hoy-milonga.com - Buenos Aires
- londonmilongas.co.uk - London
- tango-argentin.fr - Paris (also used in other french regions)

#### C.1.b Too many registration processes and ways of payment.
Each event has its own particular registration processes, specially international events. Organisers use different platforms to register the users, through various forms, accessing to many different websites. Social dancers spend time and effort looking for all these, knowing how and what to fill up on those processes.
On the payment side, there is no much difference, each tango event have their own way of payment, with expensive fees and not able to work well in every country.

### C.2 Mission: Unique platfrom to find all events which unifies and simplifies registration processes, bookings and payments.
Points of Tango aims to have all events in one unique platform, where social dancers only should ask where they want to list events from, International or selecting any Country and Region. 
Points of Tango offers a platform and contacts organisers, stores, artists to inform them about this revolutionary opportunity. Now, everyone has to do one's bit, uploading the information to make this possible so everyone can enjoy the benefits.


## D. Events Module Overview

The event module offers to Organisers, Stores, Artists and Social Dancers various benefits, detailed bellow.

*Note: Contact us in order to know further details, request a Demo if necessary. We are more than happy to let you all about this application.*

*Definition: Events at Points of Tango are defined as any tango event which has a start and end time either on a specific date or on a limited consecutive days (a whole weekend or full week, for instance). Events are classified by type: Milongas, Group or Private Classes, Practicas, Championships, Marathons, Festivals, Encuentros, Meetings, Retreats, Vacations.*

The Events Module on Points of Tango supports 2 scopes:

- Local Community Events: Day to day events, what to expect to happen on regular basis or no regular but orientated for the local community. It means, we are able to list all Milongas, Classes, Practicas and local/national competitions or festivals. 

- International Events: Events which normally happen less regularly, for instance once a year. Its target is to catch the interests of dancers living abroad alongside the local community. This section hosts big international festivals, championships, marathons, encuentros, retreats and vacations.


## E. Event Listing is totally FREE

Points of Tango's goal is to host as many events as possible to be able to offer social dancers all the options available. Paid listings would only bring narrowed options to the dancers, Points of Tango will NEVER charge the listing of any event. Therefore, if an event is not yet shown on the application, it is simply because the organiser has not uploaded it yet.

## D. How and Which information can be added to an event.

To upload information to the Points of Tango platform, it is only necessary to have an account belonging to one of the organisers of the event (to create the account, it is possible to do it via web or by downloading the application). The account should have marked 'I am also an Organisers' on the profile to be able to create events. Sign in to our web platform and create your events: [Web Platform](https://points-of-tango.web.app/)

*Note: After creating International events, an admin has to validate it before the organiser can continue with the upload.*

Listed below are all different types of information which can be added to the event. There is no distiction on International or Local Events respecting on the data to be added, both scopes can add exactly the same amount of information, this is described in the next points:

### D.1. Main Event Details information.

#### D.1.a Generic Information
- Name, Description, City, Country
- Dates: Add starting and ending time. It could be on the same day (i.e a class from 6 to 7 pm on the 30/03/2022) or a limited consecutive days (from 6 pm on 30/03/2022 to 3 am on 03/04/2022)
- Contact Details: Website; Email; Phone Number
- Main Location: Add the main address and coordenates of the event for users to open your event on a map.
- Keywords: For the Search Events section, the more keywords the easier to search for your event. They could be any word which is not on the name or the city but describes the nature of the event, for instance a keyword could be 'beach' if the event were on the sea side. ***Max 5 keywords, which can be extended under the Adds On seccion***  

#### D.1.b Pictures

Each event can add a profile (logo) picture and a cover picture (Facebook's event like) and the option to add an optional Background picture for the web version. If this is not present, the cover picture will be used instead.

#### D.1.c Add Organisers and Staff

Each event may have a list of organisers. Any organiser has full access to edit and manage the event. Furthermore, each event can include Staff memebers, this is a lower admin role, with a limited access to edit and manage the event. ***Max 3 organisers and 2 Staff, which can be extended under the Add-On seccion*** 

#### D.1.d Add Videos to Events

It is possible to add a galery of videos to the events, to promote the event, activities or artists.

#### D.1.e DJs Line up

If the event hosts 1 or more DJs, it is possible to add a Line Up of these DJs. They can be added manually or by searching DJs who have an account on the platfom. Last option, the event will Tag the DJ to the event, and the DJ may then add the event on their personal DJ page on the platform.

#### D.1.f Performers & Teachers Line up

Similarly to DJs point, it is possible to add a Line Up of Performers, Musicians, Teachers, Orchestras for the event and Tag them so the event will be listed on each artist personal page on the platform.

### D.2. Full Programme of Activities

One of the features which enriches the event the most is to add the full programme, tell the social dancer all the details about your event. The programme is shown day by day with all daily activities. Activities can be anything: Registration/Check-in process; City Tours; Classes; Online activities; Workshops; Milongas; Competition; Massage sessions; and any kind of activity offered at the event.

On each activity it is possibe to add:
 - DJs (Tag them when possible)
 - Teachers (Tag them when possible)
 - Performers (Tag them when possible)
 - Virtual Meeting Rooms (for online activities)
 - Location to find the specific activity as it can be different from the main event Location.
 - Booking details, such as price, currency and capacity of the activity.
 - Video Gallery, to promote the particular activity, it could be City Sightseeing videos when adding a City tour activity or a tango performance video when adding classes or performances to present the artists.

### D.3. Request Partners for classes/workshops

When the event hosts classes/workshops, very often attendants ask organisers to be partnered on a particular class. When organisers enable this option, Points of Tango gives the option to the dancers to request for a partner on a particular class/workshop. Then, per each class, organisers would match the requests and notify the dancers easily using a tool in the plafmorm. This is a useful feature as it is a tool for organisers to manage all these requests in a simple way.

### D.4. Discussions

Each event has a space where users can make questions/suggestions. Each post is public and owned by the user (similar to a post on an particular Facebook event); Organisers can add admin messages (which are shown differently and triggers a notification to users involved on the conversation) and also act as moderators to have rights to remove any offensive post.
Organisers may create different topics for users to post on the right channel depending on their needs, for instance Accommodation arragements, Taxis shares, Restaurant recommendations, etc. ***Max 3 topics per event, which can be extended under the Adds On seccion***

### D.5. Covid Details

Due to the current pandemic, different events require specific Covid conditions to be followed by the social dancers who attend the event. It is possible to request whether the dancer needs to have a full vaccination certificate or any proof of a negative test; also tell attendants if masks are mandatory or indicate the change partners policy; etc.

### D.6. Show Room

Regularly events host Show Rooms inviting tango stores to expose their products to the attendants. From Points of Tango events it is possible to list the stores which will be having a show room at the event, therefore dancers could go through this list and access to each particular store catalogue. This brings the opportunity to the dancers to pick and collect products at the event and expose the catalogue of each store. Also, it might bring interst to a social dancer to attend the event just because a store will be present there.

### D.7. Accommodations

Events can run over consecutive days, this section is for organisers who offer accommodation options to social dancers to stay over nearby the event location or to describe the accomodation in details where the event is hosted.

There is no limit of accomodations to list per event. It allows to list contact details and location for each accommodation, their facilities, list of prices and a gallery of pictures.

### D.8. Registration / Booking process

- Registrations: The registration is personal, done from a Social Dancer account. They register, complete a form (if organisers request it), and book the activities they want to attend. This process is used on Festivals or Championships, where there is not approval needed by the organisers.
- Applications: The application is personal, done from a Social Dancer account. They apply, complete a form if organisers request it. Once the organiser approves the application, the dancer can book the activities they wish to attend. This process is used on Marathon or small Festivals, where organisers have a limited capacity so there is need to discriminate applicants.
- Bookings: A social dancer directly books activities, no registration needed. More than 1 booking can be done from the same account.

#### D.8.a Dates 

- Registration Open Date: The organisers can specify the date and time when registrations/applications to the event will be available.
- Booking Date: The organisers can specify the date and time when bookings to activities will be available.

#### D.8.b Registration forms

It is possible to add a registration/booking form when organisers need extra information, which would have to be filled in by social dancers. This form is dynamic and the organisers can add as meny questions as needed, questions have different types to simplify answers and they can be marked as mandatory and/or editables (meaning the answer can be ammended at any time).

#### D.8.c Event Packs

User can book activities separatelly, but it is possible to create bundles for dancers to book and pay for a package-price. Bundles can have as many activities as the event has included in it, but also can have activities to claim. For instance, they book 2 workshops to pick up out of 5 available. Dancer buys the pack and choses the workshops later.

#### D.8.d Add Promoters / Vouchers

It is usual that events have promoters on different cities or countries, specially international events. By adding promoters, it is possible to attach discount vauchers, depending on the organiser's need. The discount vauchers can be either a fix amount of money or a percentage of the total of the order.

#### D.8.e Payment Methods

At the moment it is possible to set up 5 payments methods:
- Direct Payment (default): Social Dancer indicates the platform the payment will be handled directly with the organiser (cash, exchange of service for instance). The payment order will stand as PENDING until organisers agree.
- Bank Transfers: Organisers can add all bank account details to share with social dancers to make the deposits. *Transfers are not yet made through the platform, we are looking at different integrations and finding the best deals for organisers. It will be added in the next few months*. After the Bank Transfer method is selected, orders will stand as PENDING until organisers confirm the deposit has arrived.
- Integration with payment gateways, the dancer would pay directly to the organisers account, therefore the event would have to set up an account on the gateway choosen before start taking payments. Options available so far are:
  - Stripe: Largely used in Europe and North America (no available on South America)
  - PayPal: Used across the world with just a few exceptions, like India
  - MercadoPago: Largely used in South America.

#### D.8.f Payment Orders

For each payment made, a payment Order is generated. This Order goes through different statuses depending on the payment method. For instance, if a social dancer makes a payment by Bank Transfer, that order will stay as PENDING until one of the organisers approves it (possibly after the money moved onto the account), then the order goes to a PAID state. On the other hand, if a payment is done by using one of our payment gateways integrations, the order goes directly to PAID state.

#### D.8.g Refunds

Orders on PAID status can be refunded, only if none of the activities included has been attended. The organiser can decide (depending on the payment method) whether the money is also refunded on its full amount.

#### D.8.h e-Tickets

Once the social dancer books at least 1 activity, a QR Code code e-ticket is generated. The same ticket will include all the activities the dancer books. This ticket has to be shown at the door of each activity for organisers/staff to scan it and verify its validity.

### D.9. Manage Registrations

For Organisers, registrations can be managed through the mobile application and through the web platform.

#### D.9.a Mobile App - Organisers View

From the mobile application, the organiser can see a special section where all attendants are listed. It is possible to perform actions over registrations/applications such as:
- List all attendants, filter by status and search by attendant's name.
- View payment Orders per attendant.
- List orders by promoter.
- Accept or reject applications.
- Accept or Reject pending orders.
- Refund Orders.
- Fetch any detail about each registration process. 

#### D.9.b Web App - Dashboard

From the Web platform (through a dashboard) it is possible to see everything described above (D.9.a) plus it offers chart options which are not present on the mobile version, such as:
- Line Chart which describes the "Likes" of the event across the time (how many 'likes' per day or per week)
- Pie Chart to show attendances on each activity and overall the event.
- Pie Chart to show event attendants filtered by Country and/or by Role.

## E. Exposure from the artist pages.

When organisers complete the full programme, every DJ, Performer, Teacher, Orchestra or Musician tagged could add the event on their particular page, which will trigger a notification to all their followers. In this way, by tagging all artists, their followers will be notified providing more exposure to the event.

## F. Events - WEB version

Each event added on the platform will be listed on Points of Tango mobile application, but also a web page is generated dinamically following a template, a website version of the event which can be shared as an URL link. On this web version, user can go through same data they would see on the mobile app: DJs and Artist lines up; Details; Full Programme; Accommodations; Registration and Booking precesses. This allows users not necessarely to have installed the mobile application in order to interact with the platform.
Example of a web template is as follow:
- International Event:
- Local Community Event:

### F.1 Personalise your Web Page Colours

Each event would have a different colour palette. Based on the cover / background picture, it is possible to change the colours of the headers, menu lines, body text colour, etc. This would make the webpage to look different for each event. There are some default colours, which we encourage to be adjusted.

### F.2 Personalised Domains

As you could see in the wesite links above, the event code and extra values are shown on the URL (longer for local communities), this makes the link long and hard for users/dancers to remember. For this reason the platform provides the option to add domains to events; easier way to be remembered and a cleaner and more descriptive link.
Example following the link above:


## G. UKATA Members <-> Points of Tango

Events from UKATA members (United Kingdom Argentine Tango Association) show on the mobile app the UKATA logo of the event to highlight the membership, but most importantly, these events are listed on the UKATA website under the [UK Tango Map](https://argentinetango.co.uk/uk-tango-events-map).


# FREEMIUM Model.
