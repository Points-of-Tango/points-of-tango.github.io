# Events Module

### Audience and Scope
This document talks about Points of Tango platform, general Vision and focuses on the Events Module dedicated for organisers and teachers. You shoud read it if you are:
- a tango teacher who host classes for any size (5 to to 50+ people) anywhere in the world.
- an organiser of local events, no matters the size/capacity of the event nor the where the event is localted.
- an organiser of an international event, no matters the size/capacity of the event nor the where the event is localted.

## Points of Tango: General Vision | The Worldwide Tango Marketplace
The purpose of this project is to gather on an unique platform (accessible on mobile phones, tablets and web), everything related to the tango comunity: International Events; Local communities Events; Tango Stores; DJs, Professional Teachers and Performers, Musicians, Orchestras. All across the world, everything and everyone, joined on a single platform for a better communication, integration, accessibility and simplicity for social dancers, organisers, shop owners and professional artists.

## Events: Points of Tango Mision on this particular module
### Problem 1: Incomplete and out of date information all over the Internet
Information about events are spread all over the Internet, across countless webpages and platforms. We can mention Facebook as the main one, where organisers rely on list their facebook events or groups to reach out the big audience. However, this platform is not well organised, not tango specific (adding too much noice with unnecessary information), and people are moving away from it reaching other (less toxic) applications.
It is not possible to find a complete and up to date website which host all events there, internationals and local communities, even less a mobile application which makes it all more interactive and simpler. Just few local comminities have (among their own many local websites options) one platform where people rely the most, examples are:
- hoy-milonga.com - Buenos Aires
- londonmilongas.co.uk - London
- tango-argentin.fr - Paris (also used in other french regions)

Furthermore, even if these websites had the latest information, each community creates their own system/platform (which beside they are not integrated with other tango sectors, like Artists, Stores and social dancers) making it hard for social dancers to know which platform works best for each city. Points of Tango aims to have them all in one unique platform, where social dancers only should ask where they want to list events from, International or selecting any Country and Region.

### Problem 2: Too many registration processes and way of payment.
Each event has its particular registration proceses, specially international events. Using different platforms, accessing through different websites which social dancers the need to spend time and effort finding out where to find it, how and what to fill up on those processes.
On the payment side, there is no much different, each tango event, including local communities have their own way of payment, some fees are expensive and do not work well in every country. Different payment procedures to follow, which also makes it hard for organisers to track and keep all this information organised.

### Solution: Unique platfrom to find all events which unifies and simplifies registration processes, bookings and payments.
Points of Tango offers the platform, contacts organisers, stores and artists to inform them about this revolutionary opportunity. Now, everyone has to do one's bit, uploading the information to make this possible so everyone can enjoy the benefits.


## Events Module Overview

What the event module offers to the Organiser, Stores, Artists and Social Dancers is explained here, point by point detailing the main features. You can contact us in order to know further/specific details but also to request a Demo if necessary, we are more than happy to let you know better about the extension of this application.

*Note: Events at Points of Tango are defined as any tango event which has a start and end time either on a specific date or on a limited consecutive days (a whole weekend or full week, for instance). Events are classified by type: Milongas; Group or Private Classes; Practicas; Championships; Marathons; Festivals; Encuentros; Meetings; Retreats; Vacations.*

The Events Module on Points of Tango supports 2 scopes:

- Local Community Events: Day to day events, what to expect to happen on regular basis or no regular but orientated for the local community. It means, we are able to list all Milongas, Classes, Practicas and local/national competitions or festivals. 

- International Events: Events which normally happen less regularly, like once a year and its target is to catch the interests of dancers living abroad alongside the local community. This section hosts big international festivals, championships, marathongs, encuentros, retreats and vacations.


## Event Listing is totally FREE

Points of Tango's goal is to host as many events as possible to be able to offer social dancers all the options available, with no restriction or reduced to those organisers who would pay for the service. Paid listings will only bring narrowed options to the dancers, Points of Tango will NEVER charge the listing of any event. Therefore, if an event is not yet uploaded on the application, it is simply because the organiser has not uploaded it yet.

## How and Which information can be added to an event.

To upload information to Points of Tango platform, it is only necessary to have an account on the platform for at least one of the organisers of the event (to create the account, it is possible via web or downloading the application). This account should have marked 'I am also an Organisers' on the profile to be able to create events. With the account, sign in to our web platform and create your events: https://points-of-tango.web.app/

Listed below all different type of information which can be added to the event. There is no distiction on International or Local Events respecting on the data to be added, both scopes can add exactly the same amount of information, this is described in the next points:

### 1. Main Event Details information.

#### 1.A Generic Information
- Name, Description, City, Country
- Dates: Add starting and ending time. It could be on the same day (i.e from 6 to 7 pm on the 30/03/2022) or a limited consecutive days (from 6 pm on 30/03/2022 to 3 am on 03/04/2022)
- Contact Details: Website; Email; Phone Number
- Main Location: Add the main address and coordenates of the event for users to open your event on a map.
- Keywords: For the Search Events section, the more keywords the easier to search for your event. They could be any word which is not on the name or the city but describes the nature of the event, for instance a keyword could be 'beach' if the event were on the sea side. ***Max 5 keywords, which can be extended under the Adds On seccion***  

#### 1.B Pictures

Each events can add a profile (logo) picture and a cover picture (Facebook's event like) and the option to add an optional Background picture for the web version. If this is not present, the cover picture will be used instead.

#### 1.C Add Organisers and Staff

Each event may have a list of organisers. Any organiser has full access to edit and manage the event. Furthermore, each event can include Staff memebers, this is a lower admin role, which means a limited access to edit and manage the event. ***Max 3 organisers and 2 Staff, which can be extended under the Adds On seccion*** 

#### 1.D Add Videos to Events

It is possible to add a galery of videos to the events, to promote the event, activities or artists.

#### 1.E DJs Line up

If the event hosts 1 or more DJs, it is possible to add a Line Up of these DJs. They can be added manually or searchable if DJ has an account on the platfom. Last option, the event will Tag the DJ to the event, and the DJ may then add the event on their personal DJ page on the platform.

#### 1.F Performers & Teachers Line up

Similarly to above point, tt is possible to add a Line Up of Performers, Musicians, Teachers, Orchestras for the event and Tag them so the event will be listed on each artist personal page on the platform.

### 2. Full Programme of Activities

One of the features which enriches the event the most is to add the full programme, tell the social dancer all details about your event. The programme is shown day by day with all daily activities. Activities can be anything: Registration/Check-in process; City Tours; Classes; Online activities; Workshops; Milongas; Competition; Massage sessions; and any kind of activity offered at the event.

On each activity it is possibe to add:
 - DJs (Tag them when possible)
 - Teachers (Tag them when possible)
 - Performers (Tag them when possible)
 - Virtual Meeting Rooms (for online activities)
 - Location to find the specific activity as it can be different from the main event Location.
 - Booking details, such as price, currency and capacity of the activity.
 - Video Gallery, to promote the particular activity, it could be City Sightseen videos when adding a City tour activity or a tango performance video when adding classes or performances to expose the artists.

### 3. Request Partners for classes/workshops

When the event host classes/workshops, very often attendants ask organisers to be partnered on a particular class. When organisers enable this option, Points of Tango gives the option to the dancers to request for a partner on a particular class/workshop. Then the organiser, per each of the classes, matches the requests and notify the dancers. This is a useful feature as it is a tool for organisers to manage all this request in a simple way.

### 4. Discussions

Each event has a space where users can make questions/suggestions. Each post is public and owned by the user (similr to a posts on an particular Facebook event); Organises can add admin messages, which are shown differently and triggers a notification to users involved on the conversation but also they act as moderators to have rights to remove any offensive post.
Organisers can create different topics for users to post on the right channel depending on their needs, for instance Accommodation arragements, Taxis shares, Restaurant recommendations, etc. ***Max 3 topics per event, which can be extended under the Adds On seccion***

### 5. Covid Details

Due to the current pandemic, different events require specific Covid conditions to be followed by the social dancers who attend. Possible to request whether the dancer needs to have a full vaccination certificate or any proof of a negative test; also tell attendants if masks are mandatory or indicate the change partners policy; etc.

### 6. Show Room

Regularly events host Show Rooms inviting tango stores to expose their products to the attendants. From Points of Tango events it is possible to list the stores which will be having a show room at the event, therefore dancers could go through this list and access to each particular store catalogue. This brings the opportunity to the dancers to pick and collect products at the event, expose the catalogue of each store and might bring interst to a social dancer to attend the event just because a store will be present there.

### 7. Accommodations

Events can run over a few consecutive days, therefore organisers regularly offer accommodation options to social dancers to stay over.
- Simply recommended acommodations nearby the event location.
- Events hosted on a Hotel Hall, this option allows organisers to provide specific details about the accommodation facilities.

There is no limit of accomodations to list per event. It allows to list contact details and location for each accommodation, their facilities, list of prices and a gallery of pictures.

### 8. Registration / Booking process

- Registrations: The registration is personal, done from a Social Dancer account. They register, complete a form when requested and book the activities they want to attend. This process is used on Festivals and Championships, where there is not approval needed by the organisers.
- Applications: The application is personal, done from a Social Dancer account. They apply, complete a form when requested. Once the organiser approves the application, the dancer can book the activities they wish to attend. This process is used on Marathon or small Festivals, where organisers have a limited capacity.
- Bookins: A social dancer directly books activities, no registration needed.

#### 8.A Dates 

- Registration Open Date: The organisers can specify the date and time when registrations/applications to the event will be available.
- Booking Date: The organisers can specify the date and time when bookings to activities will be available.

#### 8.B Registration forms

If it is needed for the event from the organisers, for any tipe of registration process (Registration, Application or Booking) it is possible to add a registration form. At the moment the users registers or applyes to an event, the form will be presented to complete. In case of bookings, this form will be show before compliting the payment to the activity booked.
This form is dynamic and the organisers can add as meny questions as needed, questions have different types to simplify answers from dancers and can be mark as mandatory and/or editables (meaning the answer can be edited after the registration process)

#### 8.C Event Packs

User can book activities separatelly, but it is possible to create bundles for dancers to book and pay for a package-price. Bundles can have as many activities as wanted included but also activities to claim. For instance, 2 workshops to pick up out of 5 available. Dancer buys the pack, chose the workshops later.

#### 8.D Add Promoters / Vouchers

It is usual that events have promoters on different cityes or countries, specially international events. By adding promoters, it is possible to attach discount vauchers, depending on the organisers need. This discount vauchers can be either a fix amount of money or a percentage of the total of the order.

#### 8.E Payment Methods

At the moment it is possible to set up 4 payments methods:
- Bank Transfers: Organisers can add all bank account details to share with social dancers to make the deposits. *Transfers are not yet made through the platform, we are looking at different integrations and finding the best deals for organisers. It will be added in the next few months*
- Integration with payment gateways, the dancer would pay directly to the organisers account, therefore the event would have to set up an account on the gateway choosen before start taking payments. Options availables so far, some are restrictet by Country.
  - Stripe: Largely used in Europe and North America.
  - PayPal: Used across the world with just a few exceptions, like India
  - MercadoPago: Largely used in Southamerica.

#### 8.G Payment Orders

For each payment made, a payment Order is generated. This Order goes through different statuses depending on the payment method. For instance, if social dancer makes a payment by Bank Transfer, that order will stay as Pending until organisers Approves it once they can see the movement on the account moving into a Paid state. That order can later on be refunded. If payment is done by card when using one of our payment gateways integrations, order goes directly to Paid and that order could later be refunded, and the money go back to the customer automatically minus a admin fee if on policies.

#### 8.F e-Tickets

Once the social dancer buys at least 1 activity, a QR Code ticket is generated. Same ticket will include all the activities the dancer buys, they would need later to present at the door for organisers/staff to scan it an verify the validity.

### 9. Manage Registrations

For Organisers, registrations can be managed through the mobile application and through the web platform.

#### 9.1 Mobile App - Organisers View

From the mobile application, the organiser can see a special section where all attendants are listed. It is possible to perform actions over registrations/applications like:
- List all attendants, filter by status.
- Accept or reject an application
- View payment Orders per buyer.
- Accept or Reject pending orders.
- Refund Orders.
- List orders by promoter.
- Any details about each registration process. 

#### 9.2 Web App - Dashboard

Access to the same information that it is possible from the App and also take the same actions, but from a more comfortable view, on desktop instead from the mobile screen. Furthermore, it is possible to see all described on 9.1 but also the web platform offers chart options which are not present on the mobile version, such us:
- Line Chart which describes the "Likes" of an event across the time.
- Pie Chart to show attendances on each activity and overall the event.
- Pie Chart to show event attendants filtered by Country and/or by Role.

## Expose from different artists pages.

As mentioned before, when organisers complete the the full programme, every DJ, Performer, Teacher, Orchestra or Musician tagged, can add the event on their particular page, which will trigger a notification to all their followers. This way, by tagging all artists, followers of all these artists will be notified providing more expusore to the event.

## Events: WebPage version

Each event added on the platform will be listed on Points of Tango application, but also a web page is generated dinamically following a template. A web version of the event which can be shared as an URL link. On this web version, user can go throught same data they would see on the mobile app: DJs and Artist lines up; Details; Full Programme; Accommodations; but also the option to register and pay for their bookins. This allows users not necessarely to have installed the mobile application in order to interact with the platform.
Example of a web template is as follow: 

### 10.1 Personalize WebPage colours

Each event would have a different colour palette. Based on the cover / background picture, it is possible to alterate the colours of the headers, menu lines, body text colour, etc. This would make the webpage to look different for each event. There are some default colours, which we encourage to adjust.

### 10.2 Personalized Domains

As you could see in the link above, event code and extra values are shown on the URL, this can make the link long and hard to remember. Therefore we have provide the option to add domains to the events; easier way to be remembered and also a cleaner and more descriptive link.
Example following the link above:

## UKATA Members <-> Points of Tango

Events from Organisers member of UKATA (United Kingdom Argentine Tango Association) present the UKATA logo on the event to recognise the membership, but most importantly, this events are also listed under the ukata website where it is also possible to visualize them on a map. [UKATA Tango Map | https://argentinetango.co.uk/uk-tango-events-map/]

## Monetization

At the moment Points of Tango is not monetizating any of it features, however most of them, related to list and populate the event with as much information possible is and will be always free.
This are the points which will be considered to monetize in future (at least towards the end of the year.

### 1. Sponsored Events

Event list is sorted by date but some events can be featured at the top of the list. Similarly to Google results, at most 2 events would be featured/sponsored at the top, followed by the 'organic' list sorted by date. Any event can be sponsored on any region, it doesn't need to belong. For instance, a milonga in London can be featured on the Paris region.

### 2. Notifications and Email targeted marketing service

Addressed pushed notifications and emails to specific communities. It is possible to target the audience the organisers aim for to promoter a particular event.

### 3. Registration/Booking service

### 4. Add ONs services

At different point on this document it was refering to this Adds ON section. Some information added to the events consumes more resources than others, therefore it is necessary to add a limit to the free use, however it can be easily extended if needed. Examples are:
- Keywords: max 5 phrases
- Organisers: max 2
- Promoters: max 2
- Staff: max 2
- Payment Gateways: max 2
