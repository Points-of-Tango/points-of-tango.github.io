You must read if you are an organiser of an international event, no matters the size/capacity of the event nor the where the event is localted.

## Points of Tango: General Vision
The purpose of this project is to gather on an unique platform, accessible through mobile and web, everything related to the tango comunity: International Events; Events on Local communities; Tango Stores; DJs, Professional Teachers and Performers, musicians, orchestras. All across the world, joined on a single platform for better communication, integration, accessibility and simplicity for everyone, social dancers, organisers, shop owners and professional artists.

## Events: Problem and Points of Tango Mision on this particular module
Information about events are spread all over the Internet, across countless webpages and platforms. We can mention Facebook as the main one, where organisers rely on list their facebook events or groups to reach out the big audience. However, this platform is not well organised, not tango specific (adding too much noice with unnecessary information), and people are moving away from it reaching other (less toxic) applications.
It is not possible to find a complete and up to date website which host all events there, internationals and local communities, even less a mobile application which makes it all more interactive and simpler. Just few local comminities have (among their own many local websites options) one platform where people rely the most, examples are:
- hoy-milonga.com - Buenos Aires
- londonmilongas.co.uk - London
- tango-argentin.fr - Paris (also used in other french regions)

Anyway, even if these websites had the latest information, each community creates their own system/platform (which beside they are not integrated with other tango sectors, like Artists, Stores and social dancers) making it hard for social dancers to know which platform works best for each city. Points of Tango aims to have them all in one unique platform, where social dancers only should ask where they want to list events from, International or selecting any Country and Region.

Points of Tango offers the platform, contacts organisers, stores and artists to inform them about this revolutionary opportunity. Now, everyone has to do one's bit, uploading the information to make this possible so everyone can enjoy the benefits.


## Events Module Overview

What the event module offers to the Organiser, Stores, Artists and Social Dancers is explained here, point by point detailing the main features. You can contact us in order to know further/specific details but also to request a Demo if necessary, we are more than happy to let you know better about the extension of this application.

*Note: Events at Points of Tango are defined as any tango event which has a start and end time either on a specific date or on a limited consecutive days (a whole weekend or full week, for instance). Events are classified by type: Milongas; Group or Private Classes; Practicas; Championships; Marathons; Festivals; Encuentros; Meetings; Retreats; Vacations.*

The Events Module on Points of Tango supports 2 scopes:

- Local Community Events: Day to day events, what to expect to happen on regular basis or no regular but orientated for the local community. It means, we are able to list all Milongas, Classes, Practicas and local/national competitions or festivals. 

- International Events: Events which normally happen less regularly, like once a year and its target is to catch the interests of dancers living abroad alongside the local community. This section hosts big international festivals, championships, marathongs, encuentros, retreats and vacations.


## Event Listing is totally FREE

Points of Tango's goal is to host as many events as possible to be able to offer social dancers all the options available, with no restriction or reduced to those organisers who would pay for the service. Paid listings will only bring narrowed options to the dancers, Points of Tango will NEVER charge the listing of any event. Therefore, if an event is not yet uploaded on the application, it is simply because the organiser has not uploaded it yet.

## How and Which information can be added to an event.

To upload information to Points of Tango platform, it is only necessary to have an account on the platform for at least one of the organisers of the event (to create the account, it is possible via web or downloading the application). This account should have marked 'I am also an Organisers' on the profile to be able to create events. With the account, sign in to our web platform and create your events: https://points-of-tango.web.app/

Listed below all different type of information which can be added to the event. There is no distiction on International or Local Events respecting on the data to be added, both scopes can add exactly the same amount of information, this is described in the next points:

#### 1.B Pictures

Each events can add a profile (logo) picture and a cover picture (Facebook's event like) and the option to add an optional Background picture for the web version. If this is not present, the cover picture will be used instead.

#### 1.C Add Organisers and Staff

Each event may have a list of organisers. Any organiser has full access to edit and manage the event. Furthermore, each event can include Staff memebers, this is a lower admin role, which means a limited access to edit and manage the event. ***Max 3 organisers and 2 Staff, which can be extended under the Adds On seccion*** 

#### 1.D Add Videos to Events

It is possible to add a galery of videos to the events, to promote the event, activities or artists.

#### 1.E DJs Line up

If the event hosts 1 or more DJs, it is possible to add a Line Up of these DJs. They can be added manually or searchable if DJ has an account on the platfom. Last option, the event will Tag the DJ to the event, and the DJ may then add the event on their personal DJ page on the platform.

#### 1.F Performers & Teachers Line up

Similarly to above point, tt is possible to add a Line Up of Performers, Musicians, Teachers, Orchestras for the event and Tag them so the event will be listed on each artist personal page on the platform.

### 2. Full Programme of Activities

One of the features which enriches the event the most is to add the full programme, tell the social dancer all details about your event. The programme is shown day by day with all daily activities. Activities can be anything: Registration/Check-in process; City Tours; Classes; Online activities; Workshops; Milongas; Competition; Massage sessions; and any kind of activity offered at the event.

On each activity it is possibe to add:
 - DJs (Tag them when possible)
 - Teachers (Tag them when possible)
 - Performers (Tag them when possible)
 - Virtual Meeting Rooms (for online activities)
 - Location to find the specific activity as it can be different from the main event Location.
 - Booking details, such as price, currency and capacity of the activity.
 - Video Gallery, to promote the particular activity, it could be City Sightseen videos when adding a City tour activity or a tango performance video when adding classes or performances to expose the artists.

### 3. Request Partners for classes/workshops

When the event host classes/workshops, very often attendants ask organisers to be partnered on a particular class. When organisers enable this option, Points of Tango gives the option to the dancers to request for a partner on a particular class/workshop. Then the organiser, per each of the classes, matches the requests and notify the dancers. This is a useful feature as it is a tool for organisers to manage all this request in a simple way.

### 4. Discussions

Each event has a space where users can make questions/suggestions. Each post is public and owned by the user (similr to a posts on an particular Facebook event); Organises can add admin messages, which are shown differently and triggers a notification to users involved on the conversation but also they act as moderators to have rights to remove any offensive post.
Organisers can create different topics for users to post on the right channel depending on their needs, for instance Accommodation arragements, Taxis shares, Restaurant recommendations, etc. ***Max 3 topics per event, which can be extended under the Adds On seccion***

### 5. Covid Details

Due to the current pandemic, different events require specific Covid conditions to be followed by the social dancers who attend. Possible to request whether the dancer needs to have a full vaccination certificate or any proof of a negative test; also tell attendants if masks are mandatory or indicate the change partners policy; etc.

### 6. Show Room

Regularly events host Show Rooms inviting tango stores to expose their products to the attendants. From Points of Tango events it is possible to list the stores which will be having a show room at the event, therefore dancers could go through this list and access to each particular store catalogue. This brings the opportunity to the dancers to pick and collect products at the event, expose the catalogue of each store and might bring interst to a social dancer to attend the event just because a store will be present there.

### 7. Accommodations

Events can run over a few consecutive days, therefore organisers regularly offer accommodation options to social dancers to stay over.
